        <h2>Evaluation</h2>
        <h3>Good Website Design: <a href="https://unseen.co/">Unseen.co</a></h3>
        <p class="web-sum">A creative production agency based in the United Kingdom.
            They specialize in transforming brands by blending meaningful branding, compelling digital experiences, and motion productions.</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> All of the colors blend in perfectly along with the text which seems to be default black or a very dark color. 
            They also have one or two white texts in the corner which brings you attention to their brand name.</li>
                                
            <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Little to no repetition when you are looking at the interface. While there is repetition in the background,
            it is related to the image in the back.</li>

            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The clickable links are positioned in the corner of the website and on other pages of the website,
            the selections are visually pleasing and horizontally aligned.</li>

            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> The clickable links are in the corners but the texts are colored to where it is noticable and easy to spot.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Bad Website Design: <a href="https://lowes.com/">Lowes.com</a></h3>
        <p class="web-sum">Lowe's is a leading home improvement retailer that offers a wide range of products, including tools, appliances, building materials, and home d√©cor. With thousands of stores across North America, 
            Lowe's provides DIYers and professionals with the supplies and expertise needed for home renovation and maintenance projects.</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The website's primary background color is white with red bars going across the website.
                inside the red bars includes the blue "Lowes" logo which is a bad contrast and can be unappealing to customers.</li>

            <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Lowes has reptitive boxes as well as the red bar and blue "Lowes" logo.</li>

            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Many boxes are vertically and horizontally unaligned. While some of the selections are aligned in a grid-style,
            it does not help the cohesiveness of the entire website.</li>

            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> A lot of the items are tightly packed together letting Lowes add more items than they normally would if they
            prioritized aesthetics over practicality.</li>
        </ul>
