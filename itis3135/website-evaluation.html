        <h2>Evaluation</h2>
        <h3>Good Website Design: <a href="https://unseen.co/"></a>Unseen.co</h3>
        <p class="web-sum">A creative production agency based in the United Kingdom.
            They specialize in transforming brands by blending meaningful branding, compelling digital experiences, and motion productions.</p>
        <ul class="web-eval-list">
            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> All of the colors blend in perfectly along with the text which seems to be default black or a very dark color. 
            They also have one or two white texts in the corner which brings you attention to their brand name.</li>
                                
            <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Little to no repetition when you are looking at the interface. While there is repetition in the background,
            it is related to the image in the back.</li>

            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The clickable links are positioned in the corner of the website and on other pages of the website,
            the selections are visually pleasing and horizontally aligned.</li>

            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> The clickable links are in the corners but the texts are colored to where it is noticable and easy to spot.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Bad Website Design: <a href="https://lowes.com/">Lowes.com</a></h3>
        <p class="web-sum">Lowe's is a leading home improvement retailer that offers a wide range of products, including tools, appliances, building materials, and home décor. With thousands of stores across North America, 
            Lowe's provides DIYers and professionals with the supplies and expertise needed for home renovation and maintenance projects.</p>
        <ul class="web-eval-list">
            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The website's primary background color is white with red bars going across the website.
                inside the red bars includes the blue "Lowes" logo which is a bad contrast and can be unappealing to customers.</li>

            <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Lowes has reptitive boxes as well as the red bar and blue "Lowes" logo.</li>

            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Many boxes are vertically and horizontally unaligned. While some of the selections are aligned in a grid-style,
            it does not help the cohesiveness of the entire website.</li>

            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> A lot of the items are tightly packed together letting Lowes add more items than they normally would if they
            prioritized aesthetics over practicality.</li>
            </ul>
