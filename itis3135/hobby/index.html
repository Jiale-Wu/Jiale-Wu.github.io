        <p>
            Volleyball is a game played by two teams of six players each, in which an inflated ball is volleyed over a high net. 
            Each team tries to make the ball touch the court within the opposing side's playing areas before it can be returned. 
            A team is allowed to touch the ball three times before returning it. The catch is that you can only make contact with
            the ball for a very brief amount of time which makes an interesting premise. 
        </p>

            Mikasa is one of the most famous volleyball brands. It's even used in the professional settings like in the 
            FIVB (Fédération Internationale de Volleyball). Personally, this is my preferred brand as the ball is incredibly aerodynamic
            and has a lot of grip allowing you to generate massive spin.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Volleyball is a hobby that I picked up almost 2 years ago. 
            It started off as a desire to play after consuming a hefty amount of 
            volleyball content online whether it be professional volleyball clips or an anime like Haikyuu.
            While I've been busy with schoolwork, I still try and find time to play volleyball at least once a week.


        </p>

            <figcaption><i>This was when I first started playing volleyball at UNC Charlotte</i></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            When I first started, I was reluctant to play due to my lack of skill. However, my friends eventually convinced me to go
            to a nearby community center that had a volleyball session once a week. needless to say, I fell in love with volleyball.
            Because of how we only had volleyball once a week, I was always looking forward to playing.

        <h2>When Do I Usually Go</h2>
        <p>
            Due to my schedule and workload, I usually like to play Monday Wednesday and Friday night. 
            
        </p>
        <p>
            Since we are all Charlotte students (right...?) I'd like to provide great times to play depending on what you'd like to do.
        </p>

                <th>Solo/Small Group Practice</th>

            If you frequently go to UREC, you will quickly notice a pattern with how many people are on the court at what time. The busiest
            times are usually 6-10 which is when most students are done with classes. It can be intimidating to ask people to join their teams but 
            trying your best is what matters!

        <h2>Where Do I Usually Go</h2>
        <p>
            I don't live in Charlotte so when I am back at home, I usually play in my backyard or at a community center nearby.
            There are also community centers in Raleigh that I go to as well so I can get multiple days of volleyball in.
        </p>

            <figcaption><i>community center</i></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            When I'm in Charlotte, I like to go to the University Recreation Center. Personally, this is a much more convenient spot because
            I can go anytime I'm free instead of being restricted to a date and time. The people at the UREC are also a lot more skilled so 
            I learn alot more than playing at the community center.
        </p>

    <section id="how">
        <h2>What You Need To Play</h2>
        <p>There aren't a lot of things you need to play casually. The bare minimum is a pair of sneakers, a volleyball, and 
            a net. However, if you wish to have a better, I recommend basketball shoes for more grip on the court. This will prevent you
            from slipping and provide comfort during intense matches. Another one is a high quality volleyball. A good brand is the Mikasa.
            A high quality ball goes for around 70 dollars on Amazon which can be a big investment, but, you will definitely get a better
            experience from using a professional ball. While I RECOMMEND the brand Mikasa, any official ball brand will do.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>While the Mikasa brand is what I recommend when you are playing in-doors, sand volleyball is a different story. One good brand
            is the Wilson brand. You may wonder what the difference between in-door and out-door balls is, the difference is the material.
            Out-door balls are more durable and has more grip than the in-door ball allowing different playstyles than in-door volleyball.
            When you play beach, you have less mobility so the ball caters a more creative and cunning playstyle.

    <section id="why">
        <h2>Why You Should Play</h2>
        <p>Volleyball, on a surface level, is often considered an easy sport. Anyone who is somewhat athletic can jump high and hit the
            ball hard. However, there is so much more to volleyball than just that. Outside of spiking the ball, you can set and pass. These
            are the hardest mechanics of volleyball. Being able to slowly learn the skills to be able to control where the ball goes with just
            your arms is a very exciting feeling and you can clearly feel yourself becoming better. Not to mention, similar to soccer, there are 
            multiple ways you can hit the ball allowing the ball to move a certain way. whether it be top spin, side spin, or no spin, these are
            just a few things that you can learn and they're most definitely not easy.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
            Another reason is it can be a very good way to cool off after a work out or burn a few calories. Constantly jumping can
            improve various parts of your body including your arms, back, and legs.
