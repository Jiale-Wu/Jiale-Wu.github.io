            Volleyball is a game played by two teams of six players each, in which an inflated ball is volleyed over a high net. 
            Each team tries to make the ball touch the court within the opposing side's playing areas before it can be returned. 
            A team is allowed to touch the ball three times before returning it. The catch is that you can only make contact with
            the ball for a very brief amount of time which makes an interesting premise.

            Mikasa is one of the most famous volleyball brands. It's even used in the professional settings like in the 
            FIVB (Fédération Internationale de Volleyball). Personally, this is my preferred brand as the ball is incredibly aerodynamic
            and has a lot of grip allowing you to generate massive spin.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Volleyball is a hobby that I picked up almost 2 years ago. 
            It started off as a desire to play after consuming a hefty amount of 
            volleyball content online whether it be professional volleyball clips or an anime like Haikyuu.
            While I've been busy with schoolwork, I still try and find time to play volleyball at least once a week.

            <figcaption><i>This was when I first started playing volleyball at UNC Charlotte</i></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            When I first started, I was reluctant to play due to my lack of skill. However, my friends eventually convinced me to go
            to a nearby community center that had a volleyball session once a week. needless to say, I fell in love with volleyball.
            Because of how we only had volleyball once a week, I was always looking forward to playing.
